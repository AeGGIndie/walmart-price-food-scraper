The purpose of this program is to grab the prices of food on [Walmart](https://www.walmart.ca/). It is specifically catered to work with ingredients and is **NOT** meant to be used to search other unrelated things.

It is currently a work-in-progress and requires a couple of features to be implemented in order to be used fully in combination with API calls.
